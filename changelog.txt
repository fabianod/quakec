there goes

r2 committed on Oct 2, 2014
id1
- shambler lightning origin now properly follows his frames
- glowingclaws appear one frame later
- a plug to stop him from smashing corpses (annoying)
- some gibs touch optimizing
- SpawnBlood_Expl more bloody
- more gibs for large monsters

r3 committed on Oct 2, 2014
id1
- errors in builtin declarations (findchain_*tofield), which freaked fteqcc out somehow

id1/frikbot
- straightened out borking of frikbot due to deathcam/bodyque logic (cause was unhandled MOVETYPE_FOLLOW in bot physics)
- fresh bodyque spawns seemed to mess with RadiusDamage iteration (now they don't take damage immediately)
- put RadiusDamage on separate .chain for more stability (just in case)
- shotgun shells in dm disappear real quick


r4 committed on Oct 17, 2014
common
- misc formatting tweaks here and there

id1
- big ugly hack attempt to propetly initialize info_notnulls from custom maps (make them init new thinkers, fields, etc)
doesn't exactly work as it should atm.

subs.qc:
- rewrote SUB_Fadeaway: has new own fields and should be more efficient now. changed all occurences accordingly
- changed SUB_CheckRefire and SUB_AttackFinished to use their own special field, as i was way too liberal with .cnt everywhere

weapon_projectile.qc
- wallspikes shot by trap_shooters now look for existing ones at the same .origin and remone them (framerate hog of sorts)
- shell casings stop emitting smoke upon coming to a stop

hipnotic
weapons.qc
- hiplaser didn't have quad hit effect

r6 committed on Oct 29, 2014
id1
- monster_general.qc: rewrote monster_start functions more in vein with the default ones (non-authentic think timing always kinda rubbed me the wrong way)
- monster_movement.qc, ent_misc.qc: (supposed optimisation) a new function for actual client los checking; to be used by smoke spawners, maybe other effects
- weapon_projectile.qc, ent_misc.qc: added EF_LOWPRECISION to shell casings and smokers
- utils.qc: anglemod functions have more sensible names now

frikbot
- added global variable for waypoint location path


r7 committed on Dec 12, 2014
id1
- info_notnull fuckery removed

hipnotic
- hipnotic's gremlin didn't spend ammo when firing grenades

r8 committed on Feb 17, 2015
added zer client & server, attempting to fix some bugs under dp

r9 committed on Feb 17, 2015
id1
cheats.qc:
- added BotCheat (godmode + impulse 9 + permanent quad to bots in coop; godmode doesn't seem to work although it directly gives the flag)
triggers.qc:
- reworked trigger_hurt affecting multiple targets at once (some simple and sensible logic now. the uqp version which i had previously was borked all over but it did work *somehow*. never bothered to check myself though)

zer
- swapped some weaponslots in client
- forgot to comment some lines in changeweapon

r10 committed on Nov 18, 2015

- added idle frames for tarbaby
- colored blood and gibs for wizard and tarbaby
- added knights' swing miss and slash sounds
- cool new ogre mortar code
- shootable and gibbable crucified zombies
